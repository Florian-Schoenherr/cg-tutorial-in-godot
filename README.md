# Computergraphics lecture tutorial in godot

## Installation note

On Linux, to install dotnet, don't use microsoft's installer.
At least by default it will not install dotnet to "/usr/share", which is what godot C# wants.

Instead, find out how to install it via your distros package manager.
For example, on Ubuntu (depending on when you read this, godot might need a more recent version):
```sh
sudo apt install dotnet-sdk-6.0
```
